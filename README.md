## 🔍 Introduction

Cryptocurrency predictions are critical for guiding the decision-making processes of investors and traders. These predictions aim to forecast future price movements based on historical data. Since different models operate on various assumptions and calculations, results and accuracy rates can vary.

With the advancement of technology and data analytics, cryptocurrency predictions have become more complex and accurate than ever before. Techniques such as machine learning and deep learning play a significant role in making more precise and reliable predictions.

## 📊 Models Used

### 📈 Linear Regression

Linear regression is a method that models the relationship between a dependent variable (e.g., cryptocurrency price) and one or more independent variables (e.g., trading volume, previous prices). Although it is a simple and straightforward method, it may be limited in capturing complex price movements. It can be effective in situations where linear relationships hold true.

### 📈 SARIMA

SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) is a technique that models time series data while accounting for seasonal effects. This model can capture both short-term and long-term trends and addresses the impact of seasonal fluctuations. For example, price movements that increase or decrease during specific periods can be analyzed with SARIMA.

### 📉 ARIMA

ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) is a commonly used model for time series data. Future values are predicted by jointly evaluating past values and error terms. However, it does not account for seasonal effects, making it more suitable for scenarios where seasonal fluctuations are absent.

## 🚀 Advanced Models

### 💻 LSTM

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a deep learning-based model capable of learning long-term dependencies in time series data. It has been proven effective in capturing the complex dynamics of cryptocurrency prices. It is typically used with large datasets. LSTM utilizes forget gates to store and use past information more effectively.

### 📅 Prophet

Developed by Facebook, Prophet is a model that facilitates predictions in time series data by accounting for seasonal effects and holiday effects. Its user-friendly interface and compatibility with various datasets have made it popular. Prophet yields effective results, especially with daily data.

### 🌳 XGBoost

XGBoost is a tree-based model commonly used for classification and regression problems. It demonstrates high performance, particularly with large datasets, and offers an effective alternative for cryptocurrency price predictions. Its speed and efficiency make it appealing for use with large data sets.

### 🌲 Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble model formed by combining multiple decision trees. By merging the outputs of different decision trees, it makes more accurate and stable predictions. It can be utilized for cryptocurrency predictions. Random Forest improves overall model accuracy by reducing the risk of overfitting.

### 📉 GARCH

GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) is a technique used to model the volatility of financial time series data. Given the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market, this model presents an important alternative. GARCH's capacity to predict volatility can assist investors in enhancing their risk management strategies.

## ⚙️ Enhancement Techniques

### 📊 Error Metrics

There are various error metrics used to evaluate model performance:

- **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** The average of the squared differences between predicted values and actual values. A lower MSE indicates better model performance.
  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** The square root of MSE. It makes the size of the errors more understandable, as it is expressed in the same unit.

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. It is commonly used to indicate the magnitude of errors.

- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error):** The average of the absolute differences between predicted values and actual values expressed as a percentage. It helps compare model performance by providing percentage errors.

- **R² (R-squared):** Indicates how well the model explains the variance of the dependent variable. A value close to 1 indicates that the model explains the data very well.

- **Adjusted R²:** The adjusted version of R² that accounts for the number of independent variables in the model. It measures the contribution of added variables to the model's performance.

- **AIC (Akaike Information Criterion):** A criterion that measures the complexity and goodness of fit of the model. Lower AIC values indicate better model fit.

- **BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion):** Similar to AIC, but it applies a stricter penalty regarding model complexity, indicating better models at lower values.

### ✅ Feature Selection

Another method to improve the success of the model is feature selection. Correctly selecting features allows for better predictions by reducing the complexity of the model. The selection of features also enables the model to operate more quickly and reduces the risk of overfitting.

## 🔍 Analysis Methods

### 📈 Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is an approach that predicts future price movements by examining past price movements. It helps identify market trends and potential entry/exit points using charts, indicators, and graphs. Technical analysis is commonly used to assist traders in making short-term decisions.

### 📊 Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis is an approach aimed at understanding the intrinsic value of a cryptocurrency. By evaluating factors such as the project, team, market demand, and competition, it helps investors make informed decisions. Additionally, market sentiment and news flows are considered in this analysis.

## 📌 Conclusion

The models used for cryptocurrency predictions offer various advantages for guiding investors' decisions and understanding market trends. The model that performs best can vary based on the dataset, seasonal effects, and other factors. Investors can make healthier predictions by using these models in conjunction.
